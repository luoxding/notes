Our whole application in 0.7b is around 3GB. Since we are using a single package, we can avoid a lot (but not all) of the overlap that takes up space when installing multiple AppImages or Flatpacks.  (Flatpak does an even greater job of deduplicating data see TiZ_EX1 comment in this thread!).</li> <li>We can expose various hidden/hard to find emulation features and allow the users to customize various experiences directly inside the application itself without needing to go into the Steam Deck\u2019s desktop environment.</li> <li>We are leveraging the power of compiling these emulators ourselves (where possible) to make a more complete unified experience a reality with custom patches.</li> </ul> <p>What are the downsides of this approach?</p> <ul> <li>You are bound to the software we ship inside our application and cannot add more things. But we are always open to suggestions on what to add next, just tell us on Github or Discord.</li> <li>That said we are experimenting with allowing users to import certain emulators early access versions like Yuzu (but no solution in the short term).</li> <li>Emulator updates need to be in point releases and not daily, since we can\u2019t update emulators inside an existing flatpak. As we apply the RetroDECK Framework on top of the emulators, we sometimes need to do some tinkering before we can release a new version. But you can expect semi-frequent emulator-update point releases, historically we have been fast if we feel the need to get something out quickly. Major new updates that add features to the RetroDECK application itself will take more time.</li> <li>There has been some issues with Yuzu in the past, but we have redone our entire Yuzu pipeline for 0.7b s it should allow for faster updates.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2023/06/01/june-2023---status-update/#what-is-retrodecks-vision-and-design-philosophy","title":"What is RetroDECK's vision and design philosophy?","text":"<ul> <li>Valve endorsed the use of flatpaks as their preferred and safe way to distribute software on SteamOS\u2019s immutable system. Many other immutable systems like Fedora Silverblue/Kionite and standard Linux distributions have also endorsed flatpaks. We also share the vision that flatpaks are the future for the Linux desktop and Linux based devices.</li> <li>Everything must be accessible from inside the application itself where possible. Once you launch RetroDECK, you should have all the tools you need to play games and configure the application. For the Steam Deck that means minimizing switching to desktop mode.</li> <li>We need to build a foundation that pushes emulation forward and expose more of the niche hardcore features in an easier way.</li> <li>We shall not be so bound by design choices that others have made but make our own path.</li> <li>We should ship the emulators with optimized settings for Steam Deck (later other devices) but also allow the users full control to create their own configs and make it easy to do so.</li> <li>We should do our best to respect user-made config changes where possible, even during the updates. Any forced changes should always be explained and give the users a prompt to accept them.</li> <li>We believe in a transparent open community: Dialog , user feedback and testing development versions will never be locked behind paywalls or subscription tiers . This comes from deep rooted beliefs in open-source freedom.\u00a0Subscriptions and donations will always only grant cosmetics like a unique discord color.</li> <li>We want to make the emulation available for everyone; from the casual to the power user. Keep it simple, everything in one application and download it like any other software. Only one thing to update.</li> <li>Prioritize security and keep everything contained as much as possible.</li> </ul> <p>How does this vision effect design?</p> <p>A good example is the new exposure of <code>mods</code> and <code>texture_packs</code> under the retrodeck folder.</p> <p>Before it was quite hard for users to add mods and texture packs into the emulators. No work for any other solution (that we are aware off) has been done to make this very hardcore thing more easy to handle.</p> <p>For the user it means no more looking into hidden folders of when and where to put the files. Our new approach also has received the blessing of famous texture packs and mod pack creators out there that were happy that someone lowered the barrier.</p> <p>So if you found it hard before to add:</p> <ul> <li>A magnificent texture pack for Citra</li> <li>A spooky HD pack for the Mesen Core</li> <li>New 3D polygon racing models for Mupen64Plus-Next Core</li> </ul> <p>Just look our wiki under mods/texture packs and look forward to 0.7b.</p> <p>https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki</p> <p>Another example is (as others have done) move <code>gamelists</code> to under the retrodeck folder. This is a safer way of doing it and it's easier for the users to take backups.</p> <p>What to expect in the future?</p> <p>You can expect most of the standard stuff like that you can except from an emulation solution in the future:</p> <ul> <li>Cloud-sync</li> <li>USB and FTP file transfer</li> <li>External controller management</li> <li>Lightgun support</li> <li>Most of the supported ES-DE emulators</li> <li>Automatic Updates from Gamemode on Launch (0.7b it can be disabled in the Configurator)</li> <li>And more...</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2023/06/01/june-2023---status-update/#what-is-the-retrodeck-framework","title":"What is the RetroDECK Framework?","text":"<p>This is the feature we have been building on since the beginning and the true hidden core of RetroDECK that we are unveiling for the first time today. It\u2019s the foundation we have built over many months of hard work and will keep expanding on in every upcoming update.</p> <p>The RetroDECK framework is a complete system that applies and adds features, fixes, structure and functions to all applications/data shipped within RetroDECK.</p> <p>This is also one of the reasons we needed to restructure save file folders in the past updates as well.</p> <p>What does the RetroDECK Framework allow you to do?</p> <p>It allows us to ship deeper choices, customization, apply settings globally, create custom patches or functions and expose hidden settings to the front.</p> <p>But what truly excites us in the team is the more advanced big features that we have not seen anyone else do on SteamOS or other operative systems.</p> <p>Some light examples in 0.7b of the framework is:</p> <ul> <li>Move everything everywhere.</li> </ul> <p>Note:</p> <p>Please be careful when moving data to exotic locations don't be like Mr.Angry:</p> <ul> <li>Log in/logout/hardcore mode for RetroAchivements hardcore mode for all supported emulators.</li> <li>Apply Borders, Shaders and Widescreen mode per emulator / core or globally.</li> </ul> <p>Note:</p> <p>RetroDECK will offer full user choice and not a blanket all or nothing. You could have widescreen on one core while the others have borders.</p> <p>What are some advanced big examples that you could do with the Framework?</p> <p>Here is one example:</p> <p>Think about configurations for emulators. How most other solutions are handling changes or updates is just a blanket call all-or-nothing. Either you accept the changes and remove everything you have done or keep your changes without getting the updates.</p> <p>What we are building with the framework is a system to inject point changes into configurations.</p> <p>So instead of doing the crude way others are doing:</p> <p>Force replace in <code>config.xml</code> old with new <code>config.xml</code> yes or no?</p> <p>What our goal is and what we are building:</p> <p>Be able to open a <code>config.xml</code> inject the changed values across all those configs.</p> <p>If an emulator updates and adds more config options, we can just add them without losing the rest of the user data.</p> <p>So we can compare changes between the new <code>config.xml</code> and the old, then inject the changes.</p> <p>But if a emulator totally change how their configuration works and makes a whole new system from scratch (it does not happen often or at all) even we will be out of luck.</p> <p>So we hope in the future to be able to save even more custom configs even with the emulator updates. We also hope to make configuring emulators easier... more on that in a future development update after the summer.</p> <p>Another big example:</p> <p>If you read the recent article, we in the RetroDECK team are happy to unveil the <code>RetroDECK: Multiuser Mode</code>. This is only the first one of the big features we have planned for future updates and stands as an example of the complicated features we can accomplish. There is even more crazy stuff in development for the future big releases then this, so consider this a taste of things to come. It will not be ready for 0.7b but can be enabled with CLI commands for testing.</p> <p>See the following Q&amp;A:</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/06/01/june-2023---status-update/#retrodeck-multiuser-mode-qa","title":"RetroDECK: Multiuser Mode Q&amp;A","text":"<p>First read here:</p> <p>https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/How-can-I-help-with-testing%3F</p> <p>This is for testing only in 0.7b!</p> <p>What does Multiuser Mode mean?</p> <p>It creates a new directory structure <code>retrodeck/multi-user-data/&lt;username&gt;</code> and allows multiple users to use RetroDECK from one device.</p> <p>Wait... what.. how?!

A player could start RetroDECK: Play a little Switch then quit Yuzu, go directly to PPSSPP and play some PSP then end up in RetroArch to play SNES before the session is over.</li> </ul> <p>That boiled down into the following points to work on:</p> <ul> <li>Check every hotkey that exists in every emulator and how they work.</li> <li>Check if some hotkeys are hardbound (none rebind-able) and see if those can be worked into the over all structure of all other emulators.</li> <li>Check what rules the hotkeys of each emulator have to bind them (single button only, only keyboard inputs, only gamepad inputs etc..).</li> <li>From the result above: Decide and prioritize what hotkeys are so important they need a physical button combo. What hotkeys are \"semi-important / good to have\" and can live in a radial menu. Decide what not hotkeys not to bind at all.</li> </ul> <p>Results so far:</p> <p>NOTE: Not all functions are supported in all emulators, but they will be added in as soon as they do support them.</p> <p>Physical button combo input</p> <ul> <li>The standard RetroArch = Start + Select to Quit and L3 + R3 for Open Menu is still there for RetroArch.</li> <li>The L4 and R4 buttons changes the layout when hold down and allows button combinations with those buttons, example: \"L4 or R4 + R1\" = Save State and \"L4 or R4 + L1\" = Load State. It allows for quick access to the following functions with just button presses:</li> <li>Save state</li> <li>Load state</li> <li>Exit/Quit Emulator</li> <li>Fullscreen On/Off</li> <li>Fullscreen Off - (NOTE: Some emulators don't have toggle and have a separated on / off hotkeys)</li> <li>Fast forward</li> <li>Rewind</li> <li>Pause/Resume</li> <li>Open Menu</li> <li>Select Previous State Slot</li> <li>Select Next State Slot</li> <li>Capture Screenshot</li> <li>Swap Dual-Screens  /  Toggle pad screen (DS, 3DS, WiiU)</li> <li>Escape key - (Useful for some Emulators)</li> <li>Freelook mode movement for Dolphin on the sticks (NOTE: as long as L4 or R4 is hold down and Freelook mode is activated).</li> </ul> <p>Radial Menu System</p> <p>The radial menu system that is on the left touchpad gives you access to 70+ hotkeys (including the button bound from above) for various functions while gaming.

This will allow you to list the ROMS you want as a separate game in the Steam interface and thus have different power profiles for each game.</p> <p>It is something many of you have requested and given feedback about.</p> <p>Dynamic viewports / scaling system</p> <p>Another new developer is looking into making a dynamic scaling / viewport system for the various emulators and cores to match the borders and resolutions to the most common screen types. \\</p> <p>This would allow better desktop screen support and better handling on undocked / docked Steam Deck resolutions.</p> <p>The goal is simple but complex:</p> <p>The borders and scale of the games should look nice and proper on your external screen when you plug in your movable device.</p> <p>Better external controller hotkey support</p> <p>As part of the Controller Unification Project and with the addition of the `SELECT` button as a hotkey trigger in 0.7.1b. We now have a better understanding of Steam Input\u2019s controller template system and should be able to make a template for common external controllers with the button bound hotkeys combos that use `SELECT` as the trigger.</p> <p>However, the entire radial menu system is a bit harder as many controllers do not have touch input or a logical and comfortable way to navigate it. We will investigate if it is feasible to port the radial system to controllers with touch and those without.</p> <p>Status on the Multi-user system</p> <p>We are still working hard on the Multi-user system, but it might not be ready for 0.8b as we had hoped. There are tons of complexity, and we want to make it right. Some parts of the development team have other IRL priorities that take preset over RetroDECK development (new baby incoming and fatherly duties).</p> <p>That is all for this month</p> <p>A minor patch 0.7.2b will be out soon with a emulator update refresh and some bug fixes.</p> <p>See you next month.</p> <p>Check out our:</p> <p>Discord</p> <p>Github</p> <p>Wiki</p> <p>Donations</p> <p>Lemmy</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/02/23/february-2024-080b-progress/","title":"February 2024: 0.8.0b Progress!","text":"<p>Highlights:</p> <ul> <li>Status 0.8.0b: All Emulators are running</li> <li>External Controllers done</li> <li>ES-DE 3.0</li> <li>ES-DE Android version</li> <li>And more!</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2024/02/23/february-2024-080b-progress/#status-080b-all-emulators-are-running","title":"Status 0.8.0b: All Emulators are running","text":"<p>Since last month all emulators we targeted are now running from within RetroDECK.</p> <ul> <li>Ryujinx</li> <li>OpenBOR</li> <li>Solarus</li> <li>IkemanGO (M.U.G.E.N)</li> <li>MAME</li> </ul> <p>What is left is to make them compatible (where possible) with some of our tools and update the configurations and inputs.</p> <p>But we are closing in on the finishing line!</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/02/23/february-2024-080b-progress/#es-de-30-in-080b","title":"ES-DE 3.0 in 0.8.0b","text":"<p>The ES-DE Team just released a major update: ES-DE version 3.0</p> <p>They are rebranding to just ES-DE and have a lot of cool new features.</p> <p>With the update also came big architectural changes.
